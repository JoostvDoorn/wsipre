===================

**wsipre** (**W**\ hole-**S**\ lide **I**\ mage **PRE**\ processing)
is a wrapper of the excellent `OpenSlide Python`_ package, which 
allows reading whole-slide images (WSI), also known as virtual slides. 
**wsipre** conserves OpenSlide Python's API and extends it to handle WSI 
annotations and to perform some slide processing tasks. The driving objective 
is the preprocessing of WSIs, with or without annotations, for Machine Learning 
(ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), applications.
